My script that I ran Scott's scripts from: create_ordered_stim.py; his functions are run from this file.

Function 1: For properly pairing object-scene and object-face pairs and assigning them to lists.

File: list_assignment.py
Function: group(intentional_encoding_test.xlsx)

Description: The file list_assignment.py contains a function at the end called group(file). This function takes in a file with the columns Trial, ImageA, imageB, categoryB, and listNum. This function pseudorandomizses the list (shuffles the order of the stimuli!) so that there are random a-b pairs; and so that each ab pair is assigned to one of 4 lists. There are 12 AB pairs in each list and importantly 6 of the ab pairs are object-scene and six are object-face pairs.

Note: this function didn't work after checking; instead use the R file called create_intentional_encoding.Rmd

Function 2: 
File: reorder_test_set.py

Description: This file contains the function generate_test_set which creates the file for the test that occurs after intentional encoding. This function takes in the file generated from the group() function above as well as a test file that contains a file with 6 columns (trial, image_a which contains 48 images from phase 1 during intentional encoding), the correct_category_pair column, and location_1, 2, 3. The file it takes as input has all of the correct_images in location_1 column, but ideally the correct image should appear in different locations across the task. (Location2 and location3) as well. This function shuffles them so they appear in different locations.

Function 3:

generate_test_set(list_num_file, test_file) this function produces test.xlsx under your current directory.

Function: generate_final_test

Description: This function will take in the intentional_encoding_test file as well as a file containing all of the images that will be tested during the memory test.


phase 3: generate_final_test(intentional_encoding_file, final_memory_test_file) this function produces final_test.xlsx under your current directory
